# Image Processing with Histogram Analysis
This project is a simple image processing tool that performs various transformations on an image, including:

✅ Grayscale conversion

✅ Brightness adjustment (increase & decrease)

✅ Detailed histogram visualization for RGB and grayscale images

The project does not rely on external libraries for image manipulation, except for PIL (Pillow) to read and display images.
