# Image Processing with Histogram Analysis
This project is a simple image processing tool that performs various transformations on an image, including:
📖 Description 
✅ Grayscale conversion

✅ Brightness adjustment (increase & decrease)

✅ Detailed histogram visualization for RGB and grayscale images

The project does not rely on external libraries for image manipulation, except for PIL (Pillow) to read and display images.
🚀 Features 

Load an image and convert it to RGB format.

Convert an image to grayscale using custom pixel manipulation.

Adjust brightness manually (increase or decrease) using mathematical operations on pixel values.

Display the original image and processed versions with their respective histograms.

Generate detailed histograms where each pixel's intensity is plotted using plt.scatter().
